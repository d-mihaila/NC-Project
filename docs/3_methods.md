# 3. Methods
This section details the setup and implementation of our Snake-NE project, including the NEAT algorithm and various experiments.

## 3.1 Snake-NE
The complete source code for our Snake-NE project, developed using the PyGame library, is available on GitHub. The NEAT algorithm was implemented using the neat-python package.

## 3.2 NEAT Setup
We describe the NEAT algorithm, including network initialization, genetic encoding, crossover strategy, speciation strategy, and mutation strategy.

## 3.3 Input Strategies
We investigate how different input features influence the snake's learning and strategies. This includes experiments with baseline, binary, and collision input strategies.

## 3.4 Ablation Experiments
We analyze the essential components of the NEAT algorithm by systematically removing key components and observing their impact on performance.
