# 1. Introduction
Welcome to the handbook for our educational project on the neuroevolution snake game. This guide aims to provide both introductory and detailed information about evolutionary algorithms, specifically focusing on the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method [@Stanley2002].

## 1.1 Learning Outcomes [come back to this as a last thing]
After working through our handbook, we expect you to have the following know-how's (please rephrase):
* have a solid understanding of Neurovolution's origins
* understand how NE works in general
* understand the NEAT algorithm, in full
* distinguish between variants of the method
* understand NE's limitations
* thus, know when NE is useful and when not
* understand the proposed enhanced methods
* be able to apply the algorithm yourself (maybe we should have a template / empty ish file for use in other cases)


## 1.2 Project Overview
Our project, named Snake-NE, aims to simplify the learning of NeuroEvolution (NE), a method that blends evolutionary algorithms with machine learning. We teach the NEAT method to evolve both the weights, biases, and topology of a neural network that learns to play the Snake game.

Now, we will more clearly introduce our project.
In short, NE aims to improve the computation efficiency and performance of a neural network by not only changing the weights of the network, but also evolve the network's architecture using evolutionary algorithms. It simulates the process of natural evolution to automatically design and train neural networks without the need for gradient-based methods. 
Let's begin by clearly introducing all of these mentioned terms, to offer us a solid ground for the rest of this lesson.


## 1.3 Problem Statement [do we even need this here?!]
Our project, Snake-NE, aims to present and teach NeuroEvolution (NE) in an immersive, interactive manner, having both a guide and practical coding experiments that students can run. We will do so by teaching the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method to evolve both the weights, biases, and topology of a neural network that learns to play the Snake game.

## 1.4 Definitions
**Neural Networks**
Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data and learn to recognize patterns. They are widely used in machine learning for tasks such as image and speech recognition.

**Reinforcement Learning**
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. It involves learning optimal policies through trial and error interactions.

**Evolutionary Algorithms**
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are optimization methods inspired by natural selection, where populations of candidate solutions evolve over generations. These algorithms use selection, crossover, and mutation to improve solutions iteratively, finding optimal or near-optimal solutions for complex problems.

**NEAT** [cuz that's what we use here]
NEAT is a specific NeuroEvolution method that evolves both the weights and the topology of neural networks. It starts with simple networks and complexifies them over generations through the addition of nodes and connections, preserving innovation through speciation.


## 1.5 Motivation [why is NE even useful?]
Snake-NE offers several benefits as an educational tool, making learning more engaging and accessible by using the simple yet fun Snake game to demonstrate complex neuroevolution concepts.
